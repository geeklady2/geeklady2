- 👋 Hi, I’m @geeklady2
- 👀 I’m a curious person, current interests are project management and teaching methologies
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced HTML/CSS, serverless development and single page applications 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing in particular, but open to ideas
- 📫 How to reach me, find me on linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sdjaeger/)

- The public code repositories are not a good representation of what I am capble of, they tend to be quick one-off
- projects done for a volunteer group, inheriting code for a volunteer group, or something developed for teaching
- purposes
